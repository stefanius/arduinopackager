Usage:

In this first beta version
Configure the .cfg file, but in most cases, this is not needed. The standard filesettings are used. 

In this version you only has to run: bash test.sh

After the execution, a .tmp folder is created in the user/home folder and alle the libraries from your *.files will be packed together. Hooray!
